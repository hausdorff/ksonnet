## ks delete

Delete Kubernetes resources described in local config

### Synopsis


Delete Kubernetes resources from a cluster, as described in the local
configuration.

ksonnet applications are accepted, as well as normal JSON, YAML, and Jsonnet
files.

```
ks delete [env-name] [-f <file-or-dir>]
```

### Examples

```
# Delete all resources described in a ksonnet application, from the 'dev'
# environment. Can be used in any subdirectory of the application.
ks delete dev

# Delete resources described in a YAML file. Automatically picks up the
# cluster's location from '$KUBECONFIG'.
ks delete -f ./pod.yaml

# Delete resources described in the JSON file from the 'dev' environment. Can
# be used in any subdirectory of the application.
ks delete dev -f ./pod.json

# Delete resources described in a YAML file, and running in the cluster
# specified by the current context in specified kubeconfig file.
ks delete --kubeconfig=./kubeconfig -f ./pod.yaml
